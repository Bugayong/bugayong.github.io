              <h1>TUGON WEEKENDERS BAZAAR</h1>
              <p>The Weekenderʼs Bazaar was meant to have a retro
                outdoors feel. Tasked with portraying this story, I
                illustrated characters in traditional Retro get-up,
                enjoying the day. The style aligned with the vocation
                of TUGON which is directed towards helping chil-
                dren and fighting child abuse.</p>

              <h1>DREAM CLOSET</h1>
              <p>Done with natural brushes on ADOBE PHO-
                TOSHOP, DREAM CLOSET was a personal
                project - a way to distress. As a student
                dormer, I usually find myself tight on money
                - or at the least I donʼt have enough to fuel
                my ambitious closet dreams. In substitution
                for this strong desire, I would draw the
                outfits I desired and keep it with me as a
                motivation driver in every commission work I
                did. It was a unique style; keeping to
                abstract humane forms, while still depicting
                me.</p>

              <h1>SUBARASHII RAMEN MAKEOVER</h1>
              <p>Now identifying themselves as a Japanese comfort food stall, SUBARASHII was a
                student-run food stall under the JSEC student experience. As a student myself, I
                became an understanding partner for the owners and was ultimately trusted to
                remake their logos, focusing on the king of Japanese comforting food: RAMEN.</p>

                <h1>CUYO, PALAWAN</h1>
                <p>As an artist for GRIDS, an org that connects
                     designers and artists with student clients, I
                    worked together with a BFA Creative Writing
                    Major to bring to life her thesis: a fictional
                    piece written about the conspicious events
                    taking place in Cuyo Palawan. The difficulty
                    of this was depicting and island I had never
                    gone to, through SAI brushes, however, I
                    made my attempt. The stitching shadows
                    added to create a creepy effect</p>

                <h1>CHRISTMAS CHEER</h1>
                <p>In my 4th year of HS (2014) I was required by
                    my teacher to make a Christmas card to be
                    sold. All proceeds would go to the victims of
                    typhoon YOLANDA. I created this piece, a
                    single shining tree amongs the scraps of a
                    horrible desire as a sign of hope amongst the
                    ruins.</p>
